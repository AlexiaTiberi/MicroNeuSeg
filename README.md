# MicroNeuSeg

**MicroNeuSeg** is a Python-based pipeline designed to perform spatial analysis of microglia and neurons in mouse brain imaging data. The pipeline processes multiple image channels—Microglia (cx3cr1gfp or Iba1), PV, and NeuN—and outputs the spatial coordinates of detected cells, enables region-of-interest masking, and allows extensive data filtering and visualization.

## 📋 Data Setup and Folder Structure

The pipeline expects data organized as follows:

![alt text](image.png)
Each subfolder represents an animal and contains TIFF images named with the following format:

<animal_name>_<section_number>_<marker>.tif

Markers should explicitly be named: Iba1, PV, or NeuN, though the code is not case sensitive.

## 🚀 Features


The pipeline consists of sequentially numbered scripts to be executed in order:

1. **0_segment_single_folder.ipynb** *(Optional but recommended)*
   - Tests segmentation configuration on data from a single animal folder - use "animal1" folder path as defined in the Data Setup and Folder Structure chapter.
   - Useful for interactive parameter adjustments via `config.py`.
   - Start with this to broadly set up the segmentation

2. **1_segment_all_folders.ipynb / 1_segment_all.py**
   - Performs segmentation simultaneously across all animal folders - use "data" folder path as defined in the Data Setup and Folder Structure chapter.
   - Interactive visualization recommended via notebook version (`.ipynb`).

3. **2_masking.ipynb**
   - Allows manual masking to define a specific region of interest (ROIs).
   - This is mandatory as this pipeline was constructed to analyze a mouse cortex, so there is a need to cut away empty parts of the images and also subcortical stuff... see the data folder for some sample images

4. **3_filter_all_folders.ipynb** 
   - Uses the mask drawn in 2 to filter the data coordinates from the segmentation

5. **4_extract_data.ipynb** 
   - This is the code that does the "data analysis"
   - It will output an excel file per section analyzed of all mice
### Parameters Extracted (per section)

Each `.xlsx` file generated by the analysis includes the following parameters for the masked region of each brain section:

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Area** | Area of the manually defined region of interest (ROI) in mm². |
| **Microglia_Density** | Number of Iba1⁺ microglia per mm² within the ROI. |
| **PV_Density** | Number of PV⁺ interneurons per mm² within the ROI. |
| **NeuN+PV-_Density** | Density of NeuN⁺ PV⁻ cells. |
| **NeuN_Density** | Total number of NeuN⁺ neurons per mm². |
| **Perc_Microglia_associated_PV_Observed** | Percentage of PV⁺ cells with at least one microglia within the specified threshold distance (e.g., 15 px). |
| **Perc_PV_associated_Microglia_Synthetic** | Same as above, but using a synthetic distribution of microglia to test for spatial association. |
| **Average_Nearest_Distance_PV_to_microglia_Observed** | Mean distance (in µm) between each PV⁺ cell and its closest microglia. |
| **Average_Nearest_Distance_PV_to_microglia_Synthetic** | Mean distance (in µm) for the same analysis using synthetic microglia coordinates. |
| **Perc_Microglia_associated_NeuNPV_Observed** | Percentage of NeuN⁺PV⁻ cells with at least one microglia within threshold. |
| **Perc_Microglia_associated_NeuNPV_Synthetic** | Same as above, with synthetic microglia coordinates. |
| **Average_Nearest_Distance_NeuNPV_to_microglia_Observed** | Mean distance (in µm) between each NeuN⁺PV⁻ cell and its closest microglia. |
| **Average_Nearest_Distance_NeuNPV_to_microglia_Syntetic** | Mean distance (in µm) for the same using bootstrapped coordinates. |
| **Perc_PV_associated_Microglia** | Percentage of Iba1⁺ cells that are close (within threshold) to at least one PV⁺ cell. |
| **Average_Nearest_Distance_microglia_to_PV** | Mean distance (in µm) between Iba1⁺ cells and their closest PV⁺ cell. |
| **Perc_NeuNPV_associated_Microglia** | Percentage of Iba1⁺ cells close to at least one NeuN⁺PV⁻ cell. |
| **Average_Nearest_Distance_microglia_to_NeuNPV** | Mean distance (in µm) between Iba1⁺ cells and their closest NeuN⁺PV⁻ cell. |
| **E_I_ratio** | This is a derivative parameters which is (Perc_NeuNPV_associated_Microglia-Perc_PV_associated_Microglia)/(Perc_NeuNPV_associated_Microglia+Perc_PV_associated_Microglia) |
